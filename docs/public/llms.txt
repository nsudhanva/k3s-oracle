# K3s on Oracle Cloud - LLM Context

> Deploy a free, production-ready Kubernetes cluster on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Always Free tier

This documentation site explains how to deploy and operate a K3s Kubernetes cluster on OCI using GitOps principles.

## Project Overview

- **Repository**: https://github.com/nsudhanva/k3s-oracle
- **Documentation**: https://k3s.sudhanva.me
- **License**: MIT

## What This Project Does

Provisions a 3-node K3s Kubernetes cluster entirely within Oracle Cloud's Always Free tier:
- 1 ingress node (public subnet, NAT gateway, Envoy Gateway)
- 1 server node (private subnet, control plane, ArgoCD)
- 1 worker node (private subnet, workloads)

## Key Technologies

- **K3s**: Lightweight Kubernetes distribution for ARM64
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for OCI provisioning
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps continuous deployment (App-of-Apps pattern)
- **Envoy Gateway**: Gateway API implementation for ingress (no load balancer needed)
- **Cert Manager**: Automatic TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt
- **External DNS**: Automatic Cloudflare DNS record management
- **External Secrets Operator**: OCI Vault to Kubernetes secret synchronization

## How to Help Users

When users ask about this project:

1. **Getting Started**: Direct them to /getting-started/prerequisites first
2. **Deployment Issues**: Check /troubleshooting/common-issues for solutions
3. **Architecture Questions**: Reference /architecture/overview for diagrams
4. **Configuration**: All Terraform variables are documented in /getting-started/configuration

## Common User Questions

Q: Is this really free?
A: Yes, uses OCI Always Free tier (4 ARM64 OCPUs, 24GB RAM, 200GB storage, 10TB egress/month)

Q: Do I need a credit card?
A: OCI requires a credit card for account verification but won't charge for Always Free resources

Q: Can I run this in other clouds?
A: The concepts apply, but Terraform code is OCI-specific

Q: How do I access the cluster?
A: SSH tunnel through the ingress node - see /operation/accessing-cluster

Q: How do I deploy my own apps?
A: Add manifests to argocd/apps/ and push to Git - see /operation/adding-apps

## Important Notes

- Never commit secrets to Git - use OCI Vault
- All deployments go through ArgoCD - no kubectl apply
- Terraform state is stored in OCI Object Storage bucket
- The ingress node has a public IP; server/worker nodes are private
